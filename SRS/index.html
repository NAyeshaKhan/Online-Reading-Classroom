      <h1 id="First_Point_Header"> Introduction</h1>

      <p>
      <h2 id="First_Sub_Point_1">1.1 Purpose </h2>

      Purpose
      The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the "Reading Progress App". It will explain
      the purpose and features of the system, the possible interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the
      constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is
      intended mostly for people involved with the developement of the system, along with users of the system and any
      other interested parties.<br> It describes the whole system in its current version, v2.0.

      </p>


      <p>
      <h2 id="First_Sub_Point_2"> 1.2 Document Conventions</h2>
      This document was created based on the IEEE Software Requirements Specification. Which was released in 1999 by
      Karl E. Wiegers. We have followed a few key conventions of our own for this document, those points are described
      below.
      <ul>
        <li> HTML semantics of H1, H2, Paragraph to denote specific sections and it's content. Each content block is
          lablled with the respective section no. and sub-section no. For example: "1.4 Product Scope" means it is the
          fourth sub-section of the first section.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Italic</i> is has been mildy used in a few places to denote terms. We have also used <i>italic</i> for the
          labels of the images or figures.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the "4.System Features" section, we have used the expanded use case diagram to describe the features. Roman
          numeric characters (I, II, III, IV..) have been used to describe actor actions and system response.
          <br>To refer alternative course of events, we have added another number with that. So, <i>'III.2'</i> means
          that this is the "second alternative event" for the "third typical events".
        </li>
      </ul>
      For the printable version, we have removed most of the CSS properties.<br>


      </p>

      <p>
      <h2 id="First_Sub_Point_3">1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h2>
      The document is mostly intended for developers, project managers, testers, and documentation writers. The rest of
      the SRS consists of the overall description of the product, including its classes and characteristics, the
      operating environment, design and implementation constraints, any assumptions taken, etc. It also consists of
      external interface requirements, the system features, and other non-functional requirements. It would be best to
      begin with the overall description section, then proceed to the system features, then to the remaining
      requirements sections.<br>
      A sperate document as user manual will be created after the first major relase of the product.

      <p>
      <h2 id="First_Sub_Point_5">1.4 Product Scope</h2>
      The purpose of the software is to be allow teachers to assign reading material and keep track of the reading
      progress of their students. Teachers can sign up to the system, create a classroom, assign PDF files, and be able
      to see questions asked and sections marked by students. The objective is to track the students’ reading progress
      on the assigned material, and the benefits of using the software include being able to determine better strategies
      to help students read faster and understand better. The goal of using the product is to improve the reading
      ability and speed of students.

      <h2 id="Second_Sub_Point_4">2.4 Operating Environment</h2>
      Software will operate on any major desktop operating system or mobile system with a web browser. A functioning web
      browser is required for the product to operate properly. Mobile systems are supported till Android version 5.x.x.

      </p>

      <p>
      <h2 id="Second_Sub_Point_5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h2>
      Android App have to be designed in Java. The web application will be developed in Laravel 8.x. A MySQL database
      must also be used, and knowledge regarding PHP, Html, CSS, and vue.js is needed, as well as proficiency in Laravel
      framework.
      <img src="images/mvc.png" alt="mvc framework" style="width: 70%">
      <br>As rule of thumb, we will be using the MVC Design Pattern as both Android & Laravel architecture supports
      that. Also, the code will be writtent in a way that no logical block will be written twice in the code.
      </p>


      <p>
      <h2 id="Second_Sub_Point_6">2.6 User Documentation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User Manual for the end users will be delievered.</li>
        <li>A brief API Documentation will be also provided with the end product so that we can adhere to that in the
          future.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>


      <p>
      <h2 id="Second_Sub_Point_6">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h2>

      Dependencies include using Livewire, Laravel UI, Tailwind CSS, Jetstream, Grade packages. Assumptions that we will
      have to use some sort of library to detect and recognize faces. As well as to parse the PDF into the mobile view.
      </p>

      <h1 id="Third_Point_Header">3.External Interface Requirements</h1>

      <h2 id="Fifth_Sub_Point_1">5.1 Performance Requirements</h2>
      Our application runs over the internet. If there is no connectivity issues from the user end, it is supposed to
      run in real-time, as normally http responses take less than a second. However, we will be using third-party
      software for image recognition. Thus, we can’t guarantee the performance of that engine. Face recognition will
      require quality image in proper light and angle.<br>

      <h2 id="Fifth_Sub_Point_2">5.2 Safety Requirements</h2>
      Pictures of students will be taken as part of tracking their reading progress, therefore, to protect them from
      possible harm, we will have to take permission while signup.<br>

      <h2 id="Fifth_Sub_Point_3">5.3 Security Requirements</h2>
      Sensitive data like password of the users shall be encrypted. We will also use HTTPS over HTTP if we deploy our
      code into a global server.<br>

      <h2 id="Fifth_Sub_Point_4">5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h2>
      This software preferes correctness, portability and testibility over everything else. However, we will also foucs
      on the aspects of reliability, reusability, and usability.
